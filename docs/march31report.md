# Team as a Whole
We've been working towards the code review on Thursday. This means 
increasing code coverage, refactoring heavily, and ensuring automation 
performs as expected. We met with our sponsor yesterday online and demo'd
part of the app.

# Ian
He implemented a drawing canvas for the video overlay. He's also working
on test coverage for that portion of the app.

# Jarred, Ervin
They've been working on ironing out Jest (testing framework) issues. We've
got some "ghost" issues that we've emailed Venkat about, and await his
input. Following that reply, we should be pretty well in hand with the
front end testing.

# Justin
He's working on re-laying out the webpage, because it's kind of ugly.

# Clayton
I've been communicating with Venkat and helping to get the React tests
running on Jenkins. I've also been working on porting to Windows, and
upping back end test coverage. Currently, we're sitting at 87%. This can
be improved on.
